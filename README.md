# wikipedia-search-engine

This is a simple Wikipedia search engine web application. The latest update includes the implementation of the debounce technique for the search input on the top of the page. The debounce technique optimizes the performance and improves the user experience by delaying the search action until the user has finished typing. This reduces unnecessary API requests and provides a smoother and more responsive search feature.

To try out the application, simply type your search query in the search input field and wait for a brief moment after each keystroke. The search results will be displayed dynamically once the user has finished typing or paused for a short period.
